WhiteBox Hackathon: Replicating *We Found An Neuron* and Extending to Subject-Verb Agreement

This repository contains the experiments in replicating [We Found An Neuron](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cgqh99SHsCv3jJYDS/we-found-an-neuron-in-gpt-2), then extending it to see if the methodology could also be applied to other tasks such as subject-verb agreement (e.g., predicting if the next word should be "has" or "have").

Please see the [presentation](WhiteBox%20Hackathon%20-%20We%20Has%20An%20Neuron.pdf) for more details.
